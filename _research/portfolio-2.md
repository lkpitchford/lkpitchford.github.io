Our group has been working on luminous star formation in a <em>z</em> = 3.65 quasar (J1607) and how an AGN might impact it, using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging in the infrared. What is particularly interesting in J1607 is the presence of an offset region of star formation about 1.5'' (or ~11 kpc at J1607's redshift) to the northwest of the quasar, originally detected in the submillimeter (the blue contours in the image below), but also visible in the infrared (the background image). Further, it [has been shown](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...660A..60F/abstract) that there is a CO companion (magenta contours) located along the same radial direction as the infrared/submilliter star formation region, but farther away from the quasar (2.3'' or 17 kpc). The authors therefore describe J1607 as a merger between a quasar host and a CO companion, wherein their interaction has caused the formation of a dusty, star-forming region (giving the infrared/submillimeter emission). This does not seem to be the case, however, as the CO companion is undetected by HST. Instead, J1607 could be a merger between the quasar host and the infared/submillimeter companion, in which the merger has stripped the latter of its gas, giving the offset CO emission.
