Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are crucial to galaxy evolution, as evidenced by the tight [correlation](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-astro-082708-101811) between SMBH masses and the large-scale bulge properties of their host galaxies. While these scaling relations suggest that SMBHs grow alongside their hosts, they are still poorly constrained at both the low- and high-mass ends. Further, current dynamical SMBH mass measurements have largely been made in galaxies with smaller sizes for a given luminosity relative to the local galaxy population. We thus targeted twelve galaxies with sizes and luminosities that are not well-represented by current measurements and observed them with Gemini's Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS), as well as McDonald Observatory's 2.7m telescope and the Hobby Eberly Telescope.

I have focused specifically on extracting the stellar kinematics from the NIFS observations, where each datacube provides spectra of the *K*-band (centered at roughly 2.2Î¼m) over the central 3''x 3'' region of the galaxy.
